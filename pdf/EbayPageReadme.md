## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
- Radios - HopeRF RFM 69 CW (915, 868 or 433 MHz) or Nordic Semiconductor NRF 24L01+ radio on board
- Operating temperature range -20 +40 Celsius
- Dimensions 46mm x 36mm x 18mm 
- PIR sensor S16-L201D
- Temperature and humidity sensor Si7021
- Light sensor BH1750, spectral responsibility is approximately human eye response.
- Over the Air, firmware updates (OTA) ready. In combination with preprogrammed Dual Optiboot boot loader and External JDEC EPROM\Flash memory chip on board the Node allows OTA software updates.
- Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip makes communication with the Node very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Node will not executing any command sent to it
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming, you need to have USB TTL Serial – FTDI adaptor
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the node into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Dual CR2032 batteries in series with high-efficiency power converter (3.5-10V)
- Supply voltage 3.5-10 Volts
- Yes, it is open sourced. Completely

Comes with Arduino example sketch and guide to IOT, Smart home ideas.

## Overview
If you are familiar with Arduino boards, the easyPIRmultisensorsBox Node is Arduino pro Mini with onboard HopeRF RFM69-CW or Nordic Semiconductor’s NRF 24L01+ radio, external EPROM flash and crypto authentication chip. To save some board dimensions the easyPIRmultisensorsBox Node does not have onboard USB-Serial converter. You need to buy FTDI Adapter for programming. External Flash chip allows burning Arduino sketch wirelessly. Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip secures communication with other controllers.
